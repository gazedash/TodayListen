The idea of the project is to get a new music daily, without the need to choose between genres and artists.
This project is based on [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) and [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3) and it is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), 
[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/), [react-youtube](https://github.com/troybetz/react-youtube), [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
